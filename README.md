# Intro to Machine Learning - Google Colab Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **Intro to Machine Learning** Colab repository! This repository is dedicated to storing all weekly Google Colab assignments related to machine learning, covering fundamental concepts, implementations, and exercises.

## Repository Structure
The repository will be organized as follows:
```

```

## Getting Started
To use the notebooks in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intro-to-ml-colab.git
   ```
2. Open Google Colab and upload the required notebook.
3. Follow the instructions inside each notebook.

## Topics Covered
This repository will include, but is not limited to:
- **Week 1:** Introduction to ML, Linear Regression
- **Week 2:** Probability Basics, Expectation & Variance
- **Week 3:** Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression
- **Week 4:** Decision Trees, Overfitting & Regularization
- **Week 5:** Neural Networks, Backpropagation
- **Week 6+:** Advanced ML topics (to be updated weekly)

## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python packages are installed (these will be automatically handled in Google Colab):
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Guidelines
- Each notebook contains explanations, code, and exercises.
- Weekly assignments should be completed and pushed to the repository for future reference.
- Feel free to experiment with the code and add additional notes.
